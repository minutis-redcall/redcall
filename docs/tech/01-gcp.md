# Google Cloud Platform Setup

We chosen to put the project in GCP because they handle security, backup, auto scaling and many things that are
expensive to do by ourselves.

We need several things in order to make the project work and maintainable:

- a VPC network, in order to build a private network for our application, without any public IP

- a Cloud SQL, that will store data of the application

- a Bastion, in order to connect to the Cloud SQL from home (to access or migrate it)

- an App Engine, which will expose the app outside

- Cloud Function to receive webhook from twilio (sms status/response)

- Cloud Tasks queues to do flow control between twilio webhook and the app engine

Do not mess up with any of the fields, **especially the "locations" (europe-west1 here)** as Google do not allow to
update an app engine instance once it has been created. Yeah, you can have many Compute Engine instances, many Cloud SQL
instances, but only one f*cking App Engine instance that is not modifiable.

## Make sure the application is working locally

You will find some help in the [CONTRIBUTING](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) and in the [development setup](00-development.md).

   <br/>![](01/54.png)

6. The format should look like this in your registrar
   <br/>![](01/55.png)

## Enable Text To Speech API

If you want to enable voice calls, you need to enable the Text To Speech API.

1. In the menu, go to "Marketplace" under "Product"
   <br/>![](01/58.png)

2. Search for "Text To Speech"
   <br/>![](01/59.png)

3. Click on Google Text To Speech
   <br/>![](01/60.png)

4. Click "Enable" button
   <br/>![](01/61.png)

## Create a Cloud Storage bucket

Voice calls generate several files that are exposed on Google Storage in order to limit the number of hits on the app.

1. In the menu, go to Storage under the "Storage" category, and click "Browse".
   <br/>![](01/62.png)

2. Click "Create new bucket"
   <br/>![](01/63.png)

3. Select a name for the bucket
   <br/>![](01/64.png)

4. Select "Multi Region" and "Europe"
   <br/>![](01/65.png)

5. Choose "Standard" storage class
   <br/>![](01/66.png)

6. Select "Uniform" access control
   <br/>![](01/67.png)

7. Set a retention policy of 1 day (it's 7 on the screenshot, but don't mind, put 1, at that time I've mixed up with
   deletion rule)
   <br/>![](01/68.png)

8. In the menu, got o "IAM & Admin" on Product section, and go to "IAM"
   <br/>![](01/69.png)

9. Find the service account created for the RedCall app, and click "Edit"
   <br/>![](01/70.png)

10. Add Storage Object Admin role and click "Save" (note: screenshot is outdated)
    <br/>![](01/71.png)

11. We now need to configure objects auto deletion: go back to the "Storage" section
    <br/>![](01/62.png)

12. Click on the bucket you've just created to open it
    <br/>![](01/72.png)

13. Click on "Bucket Lock" tab
    <br/>![](01/73.png)

14. Click on "Add lifecycle rule"
    <br/>![](01/74.png)

15. Tick "Age" and put 7 days
    <br/>![](01/75.png)

16. Tick "Delete"
    <br/>![](01/76.png)

17. Save
    <br/>![](01/77.png)

## Create Cloud Task queues

In order to delegate sending messages a secure way (with retry, rate limits etc), we need several Cloud Task queues:

Warning: do not copy/paste, the first command will prompt you to enable the API.

```
# We send 10 sms/second
gcloud tasks queues create messages-sms
gcloud tasks queues update messages-sms \
    --max-dispatches-per-second=10 \
    --max-concurrent-dispatches=30 \
    --max-attempts=100 \
    --min-backoff=1s \
    --max-backoff=5s

# We send 5 calls/second (warning: Twilio's default is 1, check your Twilio Voice API CPS)
gcloud tasks queues create messages-call
gcloud tasks queues update messages-call \
    --max-dispatches-per-second=5 \
    --max-concurrent-dispatches=30 \
    --max-attempts=100 \
    --min-backoff=1s \
    --max-backoff=5s

# We can send up to 600 emails/second but don't want to destroy the instance
gcloud tasks queues create messages-email
gcloud tasks queues update messages-email \
    --max-dispatches-per-second=500 \
    --max-concurrent-dispatches=30 \
    --max-attempts=100 \
    --min-backoff=1s \
    --max-backoff=5s
```

Check the `App\Queues` class for the full list of queues used by the app.

You now need to add few permissions in your service account.

1. In the menu, got o "IAM & Admin" on Product section, and go to "IAM"
   <br/>![](01/78.png)

2. Find your app service account, and click "Edit"
   <br/>![](01/79.png)

3. Add "Cloud Tasks Enqueuer" and "App Engine Viewer" roles, the second one lets the app use an App Engine handler for
   the tasks.
   <br/>![](01/80.png)

If you don't want to use GCP, you can set another processor in config/services.yaml, see
in `src/Communication/Processor` to see the list of available processors.

## Create Cloud Functions & Task queues to handle twilio webhook

Add the following variables in your .env:

```
GCP_QUEUE_WEBHOOK_RESPONSE='webhook-sms-responses'
GCP_QUEUE_WEBHOOK_STATUS='webhook-sms-status'
GCP_FUNCTION_TWILIO_STATUS=webHooksToTasksSMSStatus
GCP_FUNCTION_TWILIO_RESPONSE=webHooksToTasksSMSResponse
```

Run `gcp/deploy/init/init_api.sh` once per environment.

This will perform the following :

- Enable required APIs
- create a service account and set the appropriate right to run the cloud functions
- create the cloud tasks queues

Then run `gcp/deploy/deploy.sh` to deploy the cloud functions

This will perform the following :

- create a temporary directory and copy the sources of the cloud function in it
- update the code with the cloud function name 'webHooksToTasksSMSStatus'
- deploy
- rename again the cloud function name to 'webHooksToTasksSMSResponse'

This creates two endpoint for webhooks that will post on different queues depending it's a SMS status or SMS response
from twilio

To run a test (using curl), you can run `gcp/test/cloudFunctions/twilioWebhooks/sendPost.sh`
This will post sample message with headers to the cloud functions, that should forward this to the AppEngine via Cloud
Tasks
